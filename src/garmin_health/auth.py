"""Garmin Connect login and the MFA state machine.

There is no OAuth consent flow for this API. ``garminconnect`` authenticates by
replaying the owner's real Garmin password against Garmin's SSO web form and
exchanging the resulting service ticket for OAuth2 tokens; those tokens are the
*output* of the exchange, not the mechanism. Garmin's actual OAuth API sits behind
the developer portal, which is the reason this project uses GarminDB at all.

Three contracts of garminconnect 0.3.11 shape everything here:

1. ``return_on_mfa`` is a CONSTRUCTOR argument (``__init__.py:371``), not a
   ``login()`` argument. Without it, login falls through to ``prompt_mfa``, whose
   default is a blocking ``input()`` on stdin -- fatal in a container.
2. In that mode ``login()`` returns early (``__init__.py:734``) without setting
   ``client._tokenstore_path`` and without dumping, and ``resume_login()`` does not
   dump either. **Nothing persists the token unless we do it.** A login that looks
   successful but writes no token would make every later sync re-prompt for MFA.
3. ``client.resume_login`` ignores its ``client_state`` argument (``client.py:1608``
   takes ``_client_state``): the pending challenge lives on the ``Garmin``
   instance, so that object must be retained between the two requests. It also
   clears the pending state in a ``finally``, so a rejected code consumes the
   challenge and the flow has to restart.

The login attempt does not survive a process restart; the token does.
